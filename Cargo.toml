It uses the i3 ipc protocol, which makes it compatible with sway and i3.\n\nBy default, each program is mapped to a unicode character for concision.\n\nThe short description of each program is configurable. In the absence of a config file, one will be generated automatically.\nSee ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/workstyle/config.yml for  details."
